Install Magisk, [LSPosed](https://github.com/LSPosed/LSPosed) Or [EdXposed](https://github.com/ElderDrivers/EdXposed).  \n2. Install the apk of this app (available from [Releases](https://github.com/BaltiApps/Pixelify-Google-Photos/releases) page.)  \n3. Open LSPosed / EdXposed app and enable the module. For LSPosed, Google Photos will be automatically selected.  \n4. Reboot. Enjoy.
